== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Question: "Where does the shortcode go? Where does the template tag go?"

Answer: The shortcode may be used on any Post or Page. For example, if you log in to the Admin Area and view a Page named "Contact", you can add the shortcode anywhere in the Page content to display the form. To use the template tag, add it to the desired location in your theme template. For example, if you have a custom page template named "page-contact.php", you could add the template tag directly after `<?php the_content(); ?>` to display the form.

Question: "Where do the [CSS hooks](http://m0n.co/b) go? How do I change the CSS for the form?"

Answer: Visit the "Appearance and Styles" panel in the plugin settings. There you may configure appearance and add custom CSS for the form.
